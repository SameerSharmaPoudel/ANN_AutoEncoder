The 'config_files' directory has configuration file(s) which contain(s) hyperparameters and other inputs required for training. 

The 'data' directory contains training data. 

The 'models' directory has architectures of models developed for training. After developing models, list them in 'models.py' file in that directory.

The 'result_data' directory contains the directories inside for each training run. The results of various training processes are stored or saved in different formats.

To generate data, run 'generate_data.py' file. The filename is printed in the console. Add that file name in 'train_data_file_path' in configuration file. 

To start training, run 'main.py' file.

But before carrying out training, the dependencies to run pytorch needs to be installed.
So virtual environment dedicated to that would be a good way.

Creating virtual envionment in Linux.
-------------------------------------
1.If pip is not in your system
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip

2.Then install virtualenv
$ pip install virtualenv

3.Now check your installation
$ virtualenv --version

4.Create a virtual environment now,
$ virtualenv virtualenv_name

5.After this command, a folder named virtualenv_name will be created. You can name anything to it. If you want to create a virtualenv for specific python version, type
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 virtualenv_name

or

$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 virtualenv_name

6.Now at last we just need to activate it, using command
$ source virtualenv_name/bin/activate


7.Now you are in a Python virtual environment. To install the requirements in the current environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

Creating Python virtualenv in Windows
-------------------------------------
If python is installed in your system, then pip comes in handy.
So simple steps are:
1) Install virtualenv using
 > pip install virtualenv 
 
2)Now in which ever directory you are, this line below will create a virtualenv there
> virtualenv myenv

And here also you can name it anything.

3) Now if you are same directory then type,
> myenv\Scripts\activate

You can explicitly specify your path too.
